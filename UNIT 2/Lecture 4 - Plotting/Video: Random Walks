 Simulation Models
 -description of computations that provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system
  being modeled
 -descriptive, not prescriptive
 -only an approximation to reality
 -'all models are wrong, but some are useful.' -george box
 
 Simultions used a lot
 -model systems that are mathematically intractable
 -extract useful intermediate results
 -lend themselves to development by successive refinement and 'what if' questions
 
 Why Random Walks?
 -important in many domains
 -ex. stock market, diffusion processes, etc.
 -good illustration of how to use simulations to understand things
 -excuse to cover important programming topics
 -ex. inheritance mechanisms, more about plotting
 
Brownian Motion is a Random Walk

Drunkard's Walk
-1 step any direction paralell to x or y axis
-after 2 steps, .25 at origin, .25 2 units away, .50 SQRT(2) units away

Expected Distance after 100,000 steps?
-will use simulation
