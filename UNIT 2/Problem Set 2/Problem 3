Problem 3: StandardRobot Class
0.0/10.0 points (graded)
Each robot must also have some code that tells it how to move about a room, which will go in a method called updatePositionAndClean.

Ordinarily we would consider putting all the robot's methods in a single class. However, later in this problem set we'll consider robots with alternate movement strategies, to be implemented as different classes with the same interface. These classes will have a different implementation of updatePositionAndClean but are for the most part the same as the original robots. Therefore, we'd like to use inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated code.

We have already refactored the robot code for you into two classes: the Robot class you completed in Problem 2 (which contains general robot code), and a StandardRobot class that inherits from it (which contains its own movement strategy).

Complete the updatePositionAndClean method of StandardRobot to simulate the motion of the robot after a single time-step (as described on the Simulation Overview page).

class StandardRobot(Robot):
    """
    A StandardRobot is a Robot with the standard movement strategy.

    At each time-step, a StandardRobot attempts to move in its current direction; when
    it hits a wall, it chooses a new direction randomly.
    """
    def updatePositionAndClean(self):
        """
        Simulate the passage of a single time-step.

        Move the robot to a new position and mark the tile it is on as having
        been cleaned.
        """
We have provided the getNewPosition method of Position, which you may find helpful:

class Robot(object):
    """
    Represents a robot cleaning a particular room.

    At all times the robot has a particular position and direction in the room.
    The robot also has a fixed speed.

    Subclasses of Robot should provide movement strategies by implementing
    updatePositionAndClean(), which simulates a single time-step.

    def __init__(self, room, speed):
