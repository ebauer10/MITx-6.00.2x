Problem 4
20/20 points (graded)
Consider a list of positive (there is at least one positive) and negative numbers. You are asked to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. For example,

in the list [3, 4, -1, 5, -4], the maximum sum is 3+4-1+5 = 11
in the list [3, 4, -8, 15, -1, 2], the maximum sum is 15-1+2 = 16
Write a function that meets the specification below.

def max_contig_sum(L):
    """ L, a list of integers, at least one positive
    Returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in L """
    #YOUR CODE HERE
    
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = L[0]
    for i in L[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(i, max_ending_here + i)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
