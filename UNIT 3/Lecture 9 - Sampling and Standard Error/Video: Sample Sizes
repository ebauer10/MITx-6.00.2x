Error Bars
-graphic representation of variability of data
-way to visualize uncertainty
-when confidence intervals don't overlap, conclude that are significantly different at 95% confidence

Bigger Seems to Be Better
-sample from 100 to 400 reduced confidence interval from 1.8C to C
-had to look at 400,000 examples

What can we conclude from 1 sample?
