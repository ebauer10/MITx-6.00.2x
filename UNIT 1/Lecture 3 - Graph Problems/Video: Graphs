Computational Models
-programs that help us understand the world and solve practical problems
-saw how to map an optimization problem and design a program to solve it
-lets look at a class of models called graphs

Graph
-set of nodes (vertices)
__sometimes properties associated with them
-nodes are connected by edges (arcs)
-undirected (graph)
-directed (diagraph)
__source (parent) and destination (child) nodes
-unweighted or weighted
-useful for capturing practical relationships among entities
__ex. atoms in molecule, rail links between cities, ancestral relationships

Trees: An Important Special Case
-a directed graph in whcih each pair of nodes is connected by a single path
__recall search trees used in knapsack problem

Why Graphs are so Useful
-world is full of networks based on relationships
__ex. computer networks, transportation networks, financial networks, 
      sewer networks, criminal networks, political networks, social networks

Getting to the office
-model road system using a diagraph
-nodes: points where roads end or meet
-edges: connections between points
__each edge is a weight indicating time it will take to get from 
  source node to desination node for that edge
-solve a graph optimization problem
__shortest weighted path between my house and my office

Leonhard Euler's Model
-each island is a node
-each bridge is an undirected bridge
-model abstracts away irrelevant details
__ex. size of islands, length of bridges
-is there a path that contains each edge exactly once?
-Euler invented a new way to think about a large class of problems
