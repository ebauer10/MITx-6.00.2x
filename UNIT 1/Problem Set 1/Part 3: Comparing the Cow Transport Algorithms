Part 3: Compare the Algorithms

Implement compare_cow_transport_algorithms. 
Load the cow data in ps1_cow_data.txt, and then run your greedy and brute force cow transport algorithms on the data 
to find the minimum number of trips found by each algorithm and how long each method takes. 
Use the default weight limits of 10 for both algorithms. 
Make sure youâ€™ve tested both your greedy and brute force algorithms before you implement this!

Hints:

You can measure the time a block of code takes to execute using the time.time() function as follows. 
This prints the duration in seconds, as a float. For a very small fraction of a second, it will print 0.0.

start = time.time()
## code to be timed
end = time.time()
print(end - start)

Using the given default weight limits of 10 and the given cow data, both algorithms should not take more than a few seconds to run.

    brute_force_cow_transport.
