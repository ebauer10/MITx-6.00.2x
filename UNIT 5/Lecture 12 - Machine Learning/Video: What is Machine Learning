What is Machine Learning
-many useful programs learn something
-linear regression learn models of data
-"ability to learn without being explicityly programmed"
-modern statistics meets optimization
-data and output go into computer and create program, then new data fed to program for output

Generalization
-deduce new facts from old facts
-limited by accuracy of deduction process
-predictive activity

Basic Paradigm
-observe set: training data
-infer something about process
-use inference to make predictions about test data

All ML Methods Require
-representation of features
-distance metric for feature vectors
-objective function and contraints
-optimization method for learning the model
-evaluation method

Supervised Learning
-start with set of feature vector/value pairs
-goal: find model that predicts value for previously unseen feature vector
-regression model predicts a real
-classification models predicts a label chosen from set

Unsupervised Learning
-start with set of feature vectors, no labels
-goal: uncover some latent structure in set of feature vectors
-clustering most common technique
-define some metric that captures how similar one feature is to another

Choosing Features
-features never fully describe the situation
-Feature engineering:
-represent examples by feature vectors to facilitate generalization
-some features are helpful, others might cause to overfit
-want to maximize ratio of useful input to irrelevant input, signal to noise ratio (SNR)
