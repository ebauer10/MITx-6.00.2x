There are 3 kinds of lies
-lies, damned lies, and statistics

Anscombe's Quartet
-4 groups containing 11 x, y pairs
-statistics about the data is not the same as the data
-use visualization tools to look at the data itself

Lying with Pictures
-scales can be misleading, look carefully at labels and axes
-ask whether the things being compared are actually comparable

GIGO
Garbage in, garbage out
-errors can be not random and systematic
-analysis of bad data can lead to dangerous conclusions
