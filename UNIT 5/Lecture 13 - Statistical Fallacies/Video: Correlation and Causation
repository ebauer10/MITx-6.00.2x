Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
-with this, therefore because of this
-humans wired to find patterns in info, and like to think causally
-can be a lurking variable

Establishing Causation
-attempt to control for all variables other than ones of interest, rarely possible
-randomized control studies the gold standard
-deal w control group and treatment group identically except with respect to thing being studied
-observational studies do not demonstrate causation

Major Topics
-optimization problems
-stochastic thinking
-modeling aspects of the world
__random walks, games of chance, making sense of data
-becoming a better programmer
__exposure to python features and libraries, practice, practice, practice
-many problems can be formulated in terms of 
__objective function, set of contraints
-greedy algorithms often useful but may not find optimal solution
-many optimization problems inherently exponential
__dynamic programming often works, memoization a generally useful technique
-ex. knapsack problems, graph problems, curve fitting, clustering
-world is predictably non-deterministic
-thinking in terms of probablilities often useful
-randomness powerful tool for building computations that model the world
-random computations useful even for problems w/o randomness
-models always inaccurate but provide abstractions of reality
-deterministic models e.g. graph theoretic
-statistical models
__simulation models (monte carlo), curve fitting (linear regression), mahcine learning
-characterizing accuracy is critical, CLM, empirical rule
