Sampling
-all statistical techniques are based on assumption that sample is representative
-if random sampling is used, we can make precise math statements about population
-easy to get random samples in simulations
-not so easy to do in field, where some examples are more convenient to get than others

Non-representative Sampling
-'convenience sampling' not usually random
-survivor bias, non response bias
-when samples not random and independent, we shouldn't draw conclusions from them
-understand how data was colleted, and whether assumptions are satisfied, if not, be wary

-context matters, a number means little without context
-beware of percentages when you don't know the baseline

Cancer Clusters
-greater than expected number of cancer cases withing a group in an area over time
-about 1000 cancer clusters per year are reported to authorities in the US

The Texas Sharpshooter
-ex post facto putting a target where they want
