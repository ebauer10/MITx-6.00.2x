 Statistics Meets Experimental Science
 -conduct experiment to gather data
 -use theory to generate questions about data
 -design computation to help answer questions about data
 -consider, a spring
 
 Linear spring: amount of force needed to stretch or compress spring is linear in the distance the spring is stretched or compressed
 spring constant, k, determines how much force is needed

Hooke's Law
F = -kd
not all springs are linear
F = 0.01m * 35,000 N/m = 350N = mass * acc = mass * 9.8 m/s^2 = 35.68 kg

Finding k
k = 9.86 * m/x

Fitting Curves to Data
-we are finding a fit that relates an independent var (mass) to estimated value of dependent var (distance)

Least Squares Objective Function
sum of residuals
len(obeserved)-1
    SUM   (obsered[i] - predicted[i])^2 
    i=0
